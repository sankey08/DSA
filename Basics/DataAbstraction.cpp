/*
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.
Data abstraction is a programming (and design) technique that relies on the separation of interface and implementation.

Benefits of Data Abstraction
Data abstraction provides two important advantages âˆ’

Class internals are protected from inadvertent user-level errors, which might corrupt the state of the object.

The class implementation may evolve over time in response to changing requirements or bug reports without requiring change in user-level code.
